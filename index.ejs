      <h3>Soil types and some of their best suited crops</h3>
      <p>Chalky soil</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Free draining, alkaline and tend to be lower in nutrients than neutral, loamy soils. Chalky soils are best suited to plants that like sharp drainage and are not too greedy in terms of nutrient requirements. Doesn't suit the growth of plants that need acidic (below pH 7) or neutral (pH 7) conditions to grow.</li>
          <li>Best crops: Apple trees, beetroot, cabbage, cherry trees, corn, pear trees, and spinach.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Clay soil</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Heavy soil with high nutrient content and can retain a lot of water. It's fine texture causes clay soil to compact easily when overworked, and it gets hard when allowed to dry out.</li>
          <li>Best crops: Beans, beetroot, broccoli, cabbage, carrots, corn, lettuce, pumpkins, rice, and squash.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Loamy soil</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Loamy soil is a mixture of sand, silt and clay soil that are combined to avoid the negative effects of each soil type.</li>
          <li>Best crops: Beans, blackberries, blueberries, cotton, cucumbers, lettuce, onions, peppers, strawberries, sugarcane, tomatoes, and wheat.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Peaty soil</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Dark brown or black in colour, and feels spongy, High in organic matter, Holds water well, Easily compacts, Can sometimes have drainage problems, Is usually a slightly acidic soil.</li>
          <li>Best crops: Beans, beetroot, cabbage, carrots, clover, lentils, parsnip, peas, potatoes, spinach, and turnip.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sandy soil</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Water drains quickly through sandy soil, washing away plant nutrients as it goes which makes growing conditions harsh for many crops.</li>
          <li>Best crops: Asparagus, beans, carrots, corn, cucumber, lettuce, potatoes, tomatoes, and watermelon.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Silty soil</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Silty soil has characteristics of clay soil -- fine particle size, prone to compaction and moisture retention -- but without the drainage problems typical of clay soil.</li>
          <li>Best crops: Apple trees, beetroot, cabbage, cherry trees, corn, pear trees, and spinach.</li>
      </ul>
