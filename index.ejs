      <h3>Soil types and some of their best suited crops</h3>
      <p>Chalky soil</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Free draining, alkaline soil that can be difficult to keep fertile as it's organic matter and nutrients decomposes quickly.</li>
          <li>Best crops: Apple trees, beetroot, cabbage, cherry trees, corn, pear trees, and spinach.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Clay soil</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Heavy soil with high nutrient content and can retain a lot of water. It's fine texture causes clay soil to compact easily and it gets hard when allowed to dry out. Has very little organic matter.</li>
          <li>Best crops: Beans, beetroot, broccoli, cabbage, carrots, corn, lettuce, pumpkins, rice, and squash.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Loamy soil</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Is a mixture of sand, silt and clay soil that are combined to avoid the negative effects of each soil type. Is rich in organic matter, retains water that drains easily, and has a neutral ph</li>
          <li>Best crops: Beans, blackberries, blueberries, cucumbers, lettuce, onions, peppers, strawberries, sugarcane, tomatoes, and wheat.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Peaty soil</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Dark brown/black colour that feels spongy and is high in organic matter quantity. Retains water well but can sometimes become waterlogged. Easily compacts and is a slightly acidic soil.</li>
          <li>Best crops: Beans, beetroot, cabbage, carrots, lentils, parsnips, peas, potatoes, spinach, and turnip.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sandy soil</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Free draining soil with poor nutrient retention and organic matter quantity. Difficult to keep fertile.</li>
          <li>Best crops: Asparagus, beans, carrots, corn, cucumbers, lettuce, potatoes, tomatoes, and melon.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Silty soil</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Has characteristics of clay soil (fine texture, compacts easily, and retains water) but does not have drainage problems. However, organic matter quantity is low.</li>
          <li>Best crops: Apple trees, beetroot, cabbage, cherry trees, corn, pear trees, and spinach.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How our crop recommendations work</h3>
      <p>The crop recommendations in this app follow the principle of crop rotation. Crop rotation involves growing different crops on arable land to keep the nutrient content in the soil balanced. Most crop families require the same the nutrients from soil, however they all drain the nutrients at different quantites. So if one crop family was to be repeatly used on arable land, the family's most required nutrients in the soil will be depeleted quickly, however other nutrients in the soil which the family does not require, will not be put to use. Crop rotation also reduces the build-up of crop-specific pest and disease problems.</p>
